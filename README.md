# arrays

## problems based on arrays.

#### 1) transition_point: Given a sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1, the task is to find the transition point efficiently. The transition point is a point where “0” ends and “1” begins.

#### 2) repeated_elements: Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.

#### 3) occurance_of_anagrams: Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
