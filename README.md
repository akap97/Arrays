# arrays

## problems based on arrays.

#### 1) transition_point: Given a sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1, the task is to find the transition point efficiently. The transition point is a point where “0” ends and “1” begins.

#### 2) repeated_elements: Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.

#### 3) occurance_of_anagrams: Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.

#### 4) MaximumSlidingWindow: Given a sequence a1 , . . . , an of integers and an integer m ≤ n, find the maximum among {ai , . . . , ai+m−1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n − m + 1. A naive O(nm) algorithm for solving this problem scans each window separately.Your goal is to design an O(n) algorithm.

#### 5) SumOfNonOverlapping: Given an array of N elements, you are required to find the maximum sum of lengths of all non-overlapping subarrays with K as the maximum element in the subarray.

#### 6) maxValueBitonic: Given an array of elements which is first increasing and then may be decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.

#### 7) EquilibriumIndex.java: Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes. Given an array, your task is to find the index of first Equilibrium point in the array.

#### 8) PeakEle: Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find a peak element in it in O( log N ) . An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour.

#### 9) CountingElements: Given two unsorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[]. They may contain duplicates. For each element in arr1[] count elements less than or equal to it in array arr2[].

#### 10) SmallestSumSubset: Given an array of integers (A[])  and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value.

#### 11) pairSwap: Given two arrays of integers, write a program to check if a pair of values (one value from each array) exists such that swapping the elements of the pair will make the sum of two arrays equal.

#### 12) SingleNumXOR: Given an array of positive integers where every element appears even times except for one. Find that number occuring odd number of times.

##### 13) LargestSubSumZero: Given an array having both positive and negative integers. The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.
