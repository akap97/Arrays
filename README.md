# arrays

## problems based on arrays.

#### 1) transition_point: Given a sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1, the task is to find the transition point efficiently. The transition point is a point where “0” ends and “1” begins.

#### 2) repeated_elements: Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.

#### 3) occurance_of_anagrams: Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.

#### 4) MaximumSlidingWindow: Given a sequence a1 , . . . , an of integers and an integer m ≤ n, find the maximum among {ai , . . . , ai+m−1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n − m + 1. A naive O(nm) algorithm for solving this problem scans each window separately.Your goal is to design an O(n) algorithm.
